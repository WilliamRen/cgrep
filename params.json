{"name":"Cgrep","tagline":"Cgrep: a context-aware grep for source codes","body":"### Welcome to CGrep HomePage.\r\n\r\n> Cgrep is a grep tool suitable for searching in large code repositories. It supports 27 programming languages and searches that go beyond the mere pattern matching. It enables context-aware filtering for all the languages and semantic searches for C/C++.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* **Multi-threaded**: Configurable number of jobs. \r\n\r\n* **Blazing fast**: Running on a single core it is nearly as fast as GNU grep, up to 6x times faster than ack-grep.\r\n\r\n* **Multi-line**, **multi-pattern** searches.\r\n\r\n* **Colors** highligthing tokens and strings matched.\r\n\r\n* **Recursive searches**: Support of languages filters and pruned directories.\r\n\r\n* **Code Tokenizer**: search for simple occurrences, regex and similar words/tokens through the Levenshtein distance.\r\n\r\n* **Context-aware filters** for Awk, C, Cpp, Csharp, Css, CMake, D, Erlang, Fsharp, Go, Haskell, Html, Java, Javascript, Latex, Make, OCaml, ObjectiveC , Perl, PHP , Python, Ruby, Scala, Tcl, Shell, Verilog, Vim.\r\n\r\n* **Semantic searches** enabled for C/C++ language.\r\n\r\n### Libraries\r\n\r\n* In addition to the Haskell platform the following libraries are required: stringsearch, cmdargs and ansi-terminal\r\n \r\n### Releases\r\n\r\n* The packages for Debian Wheezy and Jessie are available at https://github.com/awgn/cgrep/releases\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nNicola Bonelli <nicola.bonelli@gmail.com>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
