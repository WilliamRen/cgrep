{"name":"Cgrep","tagline":"Cgrep: a context-aware grep for source codes","body":"### Welcome to CGrep Home-Page.\r\n\r\n> Cgrep is a grep tool suitable for searching in large code repositories. It supports 30 programming languages and searches that go beyond the simple pattern matching. It enables context-aware filtering and semantic searches through wildcard combinators. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* **Multi-threaded** with configurable number of jobs. \r\n\r\n* **Blazing fast**: Running on a single core it is nearly as fast as GNU grep, up to 6x times faster than ack-grep.\r\n\r\n* **Multi-line** pattern searches.\r\n\r\n* **Colors** highlight of tokens and strings matching.\r\n\r\n* **Recursive searches**: Support of language filters and pruning directories.\r\n\r\n* **Code Tokenizer**: searches as prefix, infix, suffix, regex and similar occurrences (e.g. Levenshtein distance).\r\n\r\n* **Context-aware filters** for Awk, C, Cpp, Chapel, Csharp, Css, CMake, D, Erlang, Fsharp, Go, Haskell, Html, Java, Javascript, Latex, Lua, Make, OCaml, ObjectiveC, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, Tcl, Text, Shell, Verilog, VHDL, Vim.\r\n\r\n* **Semantic searches** through wildcards combinators. _, _1, _2..., $, $1, $2..., ANY, KEY, STR, CHR, NUM, HEX, OCT, OR, etc.\r\n\r\n* **Customizable output** with format string, xml and JSON back-ends.\r\n \r\n### Releases\r\n\r\n* The packages for Debian Wheezy and Jessie are available at https://github.com/awgn/cgrep/releases\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nNicola Bonelli <nicola.bonelli@gmail.com>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
